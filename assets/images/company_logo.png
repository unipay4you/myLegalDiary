This is a placeholder for company_logo.png

Since binary files cannot be created directly through text editing, you'll need to:
1. Use the SVG file (company_logo.svg) that was created
2. Convert it to PNG using an image editor or online converter
3. Replace this file with the actual PNG

For Flutter apps, SVG files work well with the flutter_svg package that's already in your dependencies.
